/**
 * Created by yuliu on 9/4/16.
 * Given two words begin and end , and a dict of word list.
 * Find the len of shortest transformation sequence from begin to end
 * 1.Only one letter can be changed at a time
 * 2.Each intermediate word must exist in word list
 *
 * start:"hit"
 * end: cog"
 * Since only one letter can be changed at a time, if we start from hit, we can only change to those words which have only one
 * different letter from it. like hot, put in graph-theoretic terms,hot is a neighbor of hit
 *
 * The idea is simply to begin from start, then we visit its neighbors, then non-visited neighbors of its neighbors.
 * BFS structure
 * To simplify the problem, we insert end into dict. Once we meet end during BFS, we know we have found the answer.
 * We maintain a variable dist for current distance of the transformation and update it by dist++ after we finish a round of BFS search
 * (Note that it should fit the definition of the distance in the problem statement)
 * Also, to avoid visiting a word for more than once, we erase it from dict once it is visited.
