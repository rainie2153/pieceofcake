//Given a non-negative integer 2D array representing the heights of bars in a matrix. Suppose each bar has
    //length and width of 1. Find the largest amount of water that can be trapped in the matrix. The water
    //can flow into a neighboring bar if the neighboring bar's height is smaller than the water's height.
    //Each bar has 4 neighboring bars to the left, right up and down side
