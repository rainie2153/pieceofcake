//Given a gym with k pieces of equipment and some obstacles. We bought a chair and wanted to put this chair into the gym
    //such that the sum of the shortest path cost from the chair to the k pieces of equipment is minimal.
    //The gym is represented by a char matrix. 'E' denotes a cell with equipment. 'O' denotes a cell with an obstacle
    //'C' denote a cell without any equipment or obstacle. You can only move to neighboring cells (left, right, up, down)
    //if the neighboring cell is not an obstacle. The cost of moving from one cell to its neighbor is 1. You cannot put
    //the chair on a cell with equipment or obstacle...
    //Assumption: There is at least one equipment. The given gym is represented by a char matrix of size M * N
    //{ {'E', 'O', 'C'},
    //   {'C', 'E', 'C'}
    //  {'C', 'C', 'C'}
//      }
    //We should put the chair at (1,0) so that the sum of cost from the chair to the two equipment is 1+1=2 which is min
