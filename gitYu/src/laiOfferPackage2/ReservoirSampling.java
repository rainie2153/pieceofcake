//Consider an unlimited flow of data elements.How do you sample one ele from this flow such that at any point during
    //the processing of the flow you can return a random ele from the n ele read so far
    //Two methods for a sampling class
    //read(int value) - read one number from the flow
    //sample() - return at any time the sample, if n values have been read, the prob of returning any one of n
    //values is 1/n, return null if there is no value read so far
